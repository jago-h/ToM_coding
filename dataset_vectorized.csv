"A child and a man, presumably the father, are cycling in the countryside. They are travelling up hills and eventually come to a halt. They leaves their bikes propped up against a tree. They are now on a hill overlooking the sea. The father retrieves a boat and it soon becomes apparent that the girl wont be allowed to join him on it. He sails off into the sunset as the child looks  on. Eventually he vanishes and the girl is left staring at the empty ocean. She cycles off and returns twice but although his bike is still there, the man is not. The child wears a worried expression and the film ends with a shot of the sun shining.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Scene opens with a father and daughter riding bikes together on a path through a field. They continue until they reach a row of trees, overlooking a body of water.  They dismount and leave the bikes by the side of the road. The father makes his way down a hill, to the water's edge, to a small rowing boat. Before getting in he climbs back up the hill and embraces his daughter a final time. He returns to the boat and rows away from land. As he travels further away the daughter runs up and down the path/cliff that overlooks the water, restlessly, as if unsure what to do next. She cycles off eventually and returns at a later date. Her father's bike is still propped up against one of the trees. She looks out across the water but it's still, lifeless. Again, she cycles off alone. ","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The clip commences with a cross view of the girl and her father, a man in an overcoat, both riding bicycles along a path in an apparent countryside or rural area. There is a closeup shot of the two bikes, contrasting the size of the two front wheels, the father's being the bigger. As the clip progresses, so too does the journey or route taken by the pair. The landscape changes slightly, trees are passed, hills are climbed, with the struggle of the ascension of the hill captured by the loss of speed of both bikes. The girl obviously trying desperately to keep up with her father is so focused she does not notice him stop and rest his bike against the tree. Eventually she does and comes back and too, rests her bike beside his. He then pulls her into an embrace and she stays in his arms. He then descends the hill and a boat on water comes into sight. He climbs back up the hill toward the tree and pulls his daughter up into the air into a strong hug. He places her down and pauses momentarily, perhaps due to emotion, and again continues down toward the boat where he proceeds to row away from the bank. She stands alone, and eventually mounts her bike and cycles away as we see the small boat, a black dot on the horizon. The colour of the scene then changes from a brightish yellow to a darker red/orange. This may be to convey emotion as the tale takes a darker twist as we see the girl coming back to the same spot at the tree where she last saw her father but to no avail, he has not returned, or perhaps he has arrived..","[0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0]"

He then gets into the boat and starts to row across the lake. The daughter seems visibly distressed and watches her father as he disappears from view.

They come to the end of the road and the father has to leave the daughter, as he sails off in a boat.  This is possibly a metaphor for his death or perhaps the end of her childhood and beginning of puberty as their relationship begins to grow further apart. The girl then cycles off alone.

"This scene features a young girl and her dad cycling together. It's not immediately clear what they're cycling to but it seems like he loves her because he keeps hugging and kissing her and is generally affectionate by picking her up. It seems like a typical positive relationship but then the father leaves and we see a boat. He returns to her daughter and I thought it looked like a goodbye which was quite sad. The father then rows away and leaves the little girl staring after him. She then cycles away only to return later as the viewer imagines she will continue to do as she waits for the day her father will return for her. The father's bike is left behind though, which may have been a promise for him to return but it doesn't seem likely since the girl is obviously older when she returns to the cliff area again to check if he's there.

Then the father went down a hill and the girl stayed on the top of the hill. At the bottom of the hill there was a lake which had a boat in it. The father came back up the hill, picked the girl up and gave her a hug. He then went back down and into to the little boat, the girl stayed on top of the hill looking at him.

"A simple story of a father abandoning his daughter for reasons unknown. The pair are seen cycling on a bare landscape to a simple setting of trees and a lake. The father embraces his daughter and - with apparent difficulty - walks down the hill to a small empty boat on water, pausing with trepidation. He seems to be deep in contemplation. After a few seconds he returns to his daughter for a second embrace, swinging her lovingly in the air before returning to the boat and rowing away from her into the unseen distance without any apparent explanation. The young girl is left alone, frantic on the side of the bank and eventually cycles away only to return sometime later (and maybe frequently) on her bike to the same spot in the hope of her father returning. Although the animation was simple, it did not take away from it's poignancy. in fact the simple fact that the story was portrayed through childlike animation made it all the more touching.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]"

There seems to be a strong connection between the two. The little girl loves her father, and he her, although may be not to the same extent. /  / On arriving on the hill, they dismount from their bicycles and look out over the water. The little girl is always watching her father's movements and actions, and tries to imitate him, like she is always striving for his approval. /  / The father begins to walk down the hill, then suddenly turns and runs back to hug his little girl lovingly. It is quite a warming scene, as it shows that although he isn't always very good at expressing it, he love his daughter very much. The hug is like a quick squeeze. It is as if he can't bare to hold on too long, perhaps because he is afraid he will not be able to leave his little girl if he contemplates too long.  /  / The man continues down the hill and gets into a little row boat and rows off across the water, into the distance. The little girl watches her father from the hill; her face full of sadness. Running one way and then the other. Eventually, she can no longer see him. She is obviously upset and distressed. I think she may not no where he is gone or when he will be back and this worries her. /  / She cycles home. The film shows the little girl cycling back to the hill, perhaps the next day. She has come back to see if her father has returned. He has not. She waits for what I assumed was some time, before heading off again.

"Both father and child embark on an adventure symbolic of life; the father teaches the daughter new life skills and lessons. As the close-up is observed of the wheels of both bicycles, the point in the child's development is seen where she is able to surpass her father in what he taught her (her front wheel accelerates slightly). There is an indication however that she eases her speed to keep at pace with her father, perhaps whom is slowly showing signs of aging and degradation. As they reach the body of water, it is perhaps time for the father to pass away, sailing away from his child into an abyss. His bicycle is left with the daughter, perhaps leaving her with the sense that he is not gone forever, that he will come back, illustrating an innocent child's inability to comprehend death. However, after returning once more, possibly at on older age able to reflect on these occurrences, she sees that the bicycle has not moved and that her father has left for good. The ending of the short film suggests closure and acceptance for the daughter, perhaps as she leaves her child bicycle behind and takes her father's, maybe one day teaching her own children the same life lessons her father taught her, continuing on the cycle of life and death.","[0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0]"

The girl must have felt very lonely as her father left and sailed away from her. This explains why she stayed standing watching him wondering when he would return. She must also have wondered if he would come back at all which would cause her to worry greatly. We know she loved her father as she stood long after he had sailed away and came back soon afterwards to see if he was coming back. By going back to the hill to see if she could see him she would have been excited and nervous in the hopes he'd be there.
